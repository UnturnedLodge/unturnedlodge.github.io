- Item name can be specified partially (e.g. *Alicep*): the shop do the following logic: 
    1. Search an item with exact name match
    2. Search items with the name that starts with given text
    3. Search items with the name that contains given text

- If the item name contains a space you have to enclose it between double quotes, like: *"military magaz"*
- The item name search is case insensitive
- When you sell items with desired quantity, the shop try to sell all the items in your backpack till the desired quantity: if you have less than desired quantity the shop still sell every item it can find
